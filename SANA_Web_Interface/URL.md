SANA stands for Simulated Annealing Network Aligner. It takes as input two networks and aligns them (schematically).

New features are continually being added to the SANA engine as well as to this web interface.

Please select two networks to align. Allowed file types are:
LEDA → .gw
NOTE
Please note the following:
The first network must be smaller than or equal to the second network in terms of the number of nodes it contains (which can be found by looking at the 5th line of a given LEDA file).
For the sake of conserving server space, network files must be less than or equal to 1MB in size.
You can specify how much time SANA runs (up to 20 minutes, plus preprocessing time which adds about 10-20%)
If you aren't aligning a network to itself, select the smaller network (in terms of node count). Choose File
If you aren't aligning a network to itself, select the larger network (in terms of node count). Choose File
